\section*{Authors' response}
To gmd-2019-21 editor decision (04 Oct 2019):
Thank you for your detailed comments regarding grammar and language.
We appreciate these and changed our text accordingly.
In the following, we will respond to the questions in detail.
\begin{itemize}

\item {\color{blue} Page 1, Abstract, line 19: Change “associated to” to “associated with” and change “resistance the ocean” to “resistance over the ocean”}
  Changed accordingly.
\item {\color{blue} Page 2, Introduction, line 15: Replace “else” with “otherwise”}
  Changed accordingly.
\item {\color{blue} Page 2, Introduction, line 34: Replace “observation” with “observations”}
  Changed accordingly.
\item {\color{blue} Page 3, Introduction, line 2: Change “sides” to “sites”}
  Changed accordingly.
\item {\color{blue}Page 3, Introduction, line 15: Worth noting that those early observations were subject to interference by other species e.g. SO2}
  Thank you for pointing this out. We add this remark and write: \emph{These early observations, however, were subject to interference by other species, e.g., $\mathrm{SO_2}$.}
\item {\color{blue}Page 3, Introduction, line 27: Worth saying at this stage why the Luhar study gives lower estimates}
  We add: \emph{In particular, Luhar et al. (2018) found that the average surface resistance of ozone over ocean ($r_c=2200\,\mathrm{sm^{-1}}$) is highly overestimated in most models.}
  We add to sentence P3L14: \emph{[...] indicates much lower amounts [...] due to lower dry deposition to the oceans.}
\item {\color{blue}Page 4, Introduction, line 5: Change to “as the beginning and duration of the greening season”}
  Changed accordingly.
\item {\color{blue}Page 4, Section 2, line 15/16: Change to “publication focussing on this is planned”}
  Changed accordingly.
\item {\color{blue}Page 4, Section 2, line 17: Change “is given in a” to “is given at a”}
  Changed accordingly.
\item {\color{blue}Page 7, Section 2.1.3, line 2: Remove “,” after both}
  Changed accordingly.
\item {\color{blue}Page 7, Section 2.1.3, equation 12: I’m not clear what the index m is referring to – can you explain or exclude if not necessary?}
  The index $m$ refers to \emph{molar}. We made this more clear. We add \emph{molar} to the sentence preceding the equation to \emph{[...] the leaf-level molar stomatal conductance in the mOSaic scheme [...]}.
  And we move the last paragraph up and change it accordingly so that it follows the equation: \emph{The maximum molar stomatal conductance is given by $g^k_\mathrm{max, m}$ which is in units of $\mathrm{mmol\,s^{-1}\,m^{-2}}$. A unit conversion to $\mathrm{m\,s^{-1}}$ is necessary in our model: [...] To annotate the differing units, we use the index $\mathrm{m}$ in Eq.~([...]).}
\item {\color{blue}Page 7, Section 2.1.3, line 27: Change to “start of the greening”}
  Changed accordingly.
\item {\color{blue}Page 9, Section 2.1.3, line 3: Change “land surface types k” to “land surface type k” }
  Changed accordingly.

  Changed accordingly.
\item {\color{blue}Page 12, Section 2.2.2, line 13: Change to “spectrally”}

\item {\color{blue}Page 13, Section 3, line 14: Give reference for CEDS here}

\item {\color{blue}Page 13, Section 3, line 17: Can you provide global annual total?}
  ...
\item {\color{blue}Page 14, Section 3.1, line 13: Change to “we show global distributions of the relative difference between mosaic and wesely\_type for surface ozone, dry deposition velocity and total ozone dry deposition”}
  Changed accordingly.
\item {\color{blue}Page 14, Section 3.1, line 14: Change “ozone burden” to “surface ozone”}

\item {\color{blue}Page 22, Section 3.3, line 16: It is unclear what you mean by “While on global average much more concise with the MACC...”}
  We make our point more clear and change the sentences to: \emph{Regarding the global average surface ozone concentration, \emph{Wesely\_type} (Supplement S.8) is more consistent with the MACC-reanalysis than \emph{mOSaic}, but shows the same tendency of enhanced ozone over the continents as the latter.
This enhancement is apparent mostly in the deep tropics and over the north-western Indian subcontinent which coincide with regions of high intensity in incoming UV radiation.}
\item {\color{blue}Page 23, Section 3.4, line 8: Change to “At 4 of the 6 sites” – and again, later on in the same section}
